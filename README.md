## Algorithm training ground

This is a safe space to work through algorithms. The concepts are taken from Hackerrank and solved here.

Mocha and Chai are being used a test framework.


## Tech Stack
* Typescript (Version 4.0.3)
* Node.js (v10.16.0)
* Mocha (v8.2.1)
* Nodemon (v2.0.6)

## Running locally

Use nodemon to  start a local mocha instance that will test against the exposed modules in the 'prep.ts' file.

```
nodemon ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha    
```
